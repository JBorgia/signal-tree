# v15 production surface audit

The RC withholds 57 symbols and ships 34. TruckTrax pass 1 proved that a real
consumer needs several of the withheld ones — see
[`trucktrax-rc1-findings.md`](trucktrax-rc1-findings.md). This document decides
what v15 exposes, and it does **not** decide it symbol-by-symbol.

> **The unit of decision is a CAPABILITY, not a symbol.** TruckTrax proves the
> capabilities matter. It does not prove the v13 API shapes are the right v15
> API shapes. Six `loader` call sites are evidence about remote acquisition;
> they are not a vote to re-export `loader()`.

Nothing here changes the public surface. Candidate A stays frozen. Compatibility
exports to get TruckTrax compiling are specifically forbidden — they would
contaminate the experiment by making the old shape the answer before the
question is asked.

## Evidence hierarchy

Used to weigh every claim in every dossier below. Higher beats lower.

```text
1. Real production usage          TruckTrax and any other actual consumer
2. Existing SignalTree semantics  identity, ownership, transactions, lifecycle,
                                  entityMap, derived state, capability planning
3. Common application requirements ordinary web-app workflows beyond one product
4. Existing implementation        useful evidence, NOT authority
5. Historical API shape           weakest evidence
```

Levels 4 and 5 are the trap. The RC currently contains capabilities that are
implemented and withheld, and "it is already written" must never become an
argument that an API deserves to exist. v15 should expose the best public
contract even where that means reshaping or deleting working internals.

## API placements to evaluate

Every dossier must consider all of these before selecting one. They are
materially different architectures, and the choice follows **who owns the
behaviour and its lifetime** — not how v13 happened to spell it.

```text
plain helper            helper(tree.$.users)
tree/subtree enhancer   enhance(tree.$.users, ...)
declaration marker      entityMap({ load: ... })
builder over a subtree  createLoader(tree.$.users, ...)
bound controller        const users = loaderFor(tree.$.users)
node feature            tree.$.users.load(...)
derived capability      tree.$.users.derived(...)
external adapter        createSomething(tree, api)
tree-level enhancer     signalTree(state, { enhancers: [...] })
```

## Dossier template

Every capability gets the same headings, so the dossiers can be compared and so
the migration guidance can be generated from them mechanically:

business jobs · call sites (site-by-site) · non-TruckTrax use cases · semantic
owner · scope · lifetime · state it must retain · interaction with
transactions / history / entity identity · SSR and browser/native lifecycle ·
possible API shapes · smallest sufficient public surface · rejected
alternatives · v13 migration · tests needed · bundle and capability cost ·
disposition.

# A1 — remote acquisition / loading

## Business jobs

"What needs to load, refresh, cache, invalidate, cancel, retry, merge, and
expose status?"

## Call sites — 19, all identical in shape

Corrected from pass 1, which counted **import** sites (6) rather than call
sites. Every one is declaration-time configuration inside an `entityMap`:

```ts
entityMap<ClearViewCustomerDto, string, { regionUrl: string }>({
  selectId: c => c.customerExternalId as string,
  load: loader(
    ({ regionUrl }) => clearViewService.getCustomers$(regionUrl).pipe(…),
    { staleTime: '30m', swr: true, clearOnParamsChange: true,
      tags: ['clearview', 'customers'], lazy: true },
  ),
})
```

| file | sites | params |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `scaletrax/…/clearview.state.ts` | 6 | `{ regionUrl }`, `{ regionUrl, customerExternalId }` |
| `scaletrax/…/dispatch.state.ts` | 4 | none, and one `{ … }` filter |
| `trucktrax-geo/…/catalog.state.ts` | 3 | `PlantFilter` |
| `scaletrax/…/v3edge.state.ts` | 2 | none |
| `trucktrax-geo/…/device.state.ts` | 1 | `{ region }` |
| `trucktrax-geo/…/work.state.ts` | 1 | `{ partyMember }` |

**The uniformity is the finding.** Every site without exception uses
`staleTime: '30m'`, `swr: true`, `lazy: true`. The only variation is
`clearOnParamsChange: true`, present on the parameterized ones. This is not six
different jobs wearing one abstraction — it is one job, configured identically
19 times. The default is doing no work: nobody has ever chosen a different
`staleTime`.

The runtime surface actually consumed is two methods on the collection node:

```ts
force ? this._$.orders.refresh(params) : this._$.orders.load(params)
```

## ⚠️ Tags are declared 78 times and invalidated ZERO times

Every site carries `tags: ['domain', 'entity']`. There are four references to
`invalidateTag` in the codebase and **all four are comments** —
`BACKEND-SEAM (Phase-2 · invalidateTag)` — describing what will happen when the
backend starts emitting entity-change events.

So the invalidation half of the cache policy has **no production evidence at
all**, only documented intent. Under the hierarchy that is level 3 (a plausible
application requirement), not level 1. A surface decision that ships `tags`
because "TruckTrax uses them everywhere" would be reading declaration as use.

## Semantic owner and lifetime

The entity collection. Every site attaches the behaviour to one `entityMap`,
parameterized by that collection's own query shape, and the runtime methods hang
off that node. Nothing here is tree-scoped.

## What is NOT owned

Entity identity (`selectId` is separate and stays separate), transaction
rollback, persistent storage.

## Open questions before a disposition

- Is `tags`/`invalidateTag` in the RC surface at all, given zero demonstrated
  use? Shipping an unexercised invalidation vocabulary is how `loader` became
  "UNRESOLVED cache-policy carrier" in the first place.
- Does the uniform `staleTime: '30m', swr, lazy` triple indicate the right
  default rather than the right option? If every consumer writes the same three
  options, they are a default, not configuration.
- RxJS in the contract: every site returns an Observable. Is that the contract,
  or an adapter?
- Cancellation and retry appear nowhere in the evidence. Neither is currently
  demonstrated; do not design for them from imagination.

**Disposition: NOT TAKEN.** Needs non-TruckTrax evidence — at minimum a
paginated list, a stale-while-refresh dashboard, and a route-scoped store.

# A2 — persistence / stored state

## Business jobs

"What state survives reload, when is it written, who owns flushing, migration,
failure, teardown?"

## Call sites — 3 leaves, 1 drain

```ts
// driver-config.state.ts — the whole of the persistence surface in production
haulerId: stored(`haulerId-${envSuffix}`, null as Nullable<number>),
truckId:  stored(`truckId-${envSuffix}`,  null as Nullable<number>),
```

Plus one `stored()` boolean flag in `app.resolvers.ts`. That is the entire
demonstrated use: **three localStorage-backed scalar leaves with env-scoped
keys.** No collections, no migrations, no IndexedDB, no failure handling.

The `stored` disposition — "NOT EARNED as RC public API" — is about a marker
carrying a large surface (`StoredOptions`, `MigrationFn`, `StoredErrorContext`,
`StoredReloadResult`, `createStorageKeys`, `clearStoragePrefix`). The production
evidence justifies a fraction of that.

## The drain is one call, and it is not `pagehide`

```ts
// background-mode.service.ts — the ONLY production call
App.addListener('appStateChange', ({ isActive }) => {
  if (!isActive) {
    flushAllStoredSignals();   // beat the ~100ms debounce window
  }
});
```

This confirms the hypothesis that `flushAllStoredSignals` is a shutdown drain
rather than a general-purpose API — and it adds a constraint that a
browser-only design would miss. **This is Capacitor on Android.** `pagehide`
does not fire when a native app backgrounds. A persistence capability that
owns its own lifecycle via `pagehide`/`visibilitychange` would silently lose
the last write on exactly the platform this consumer ships.

So the requirement is not "expose a global flush function". It is: *the
persistence capability must be drainable by a host that knows something the web
platform cannot tell it.* That could be a method on the capability, a
tree-level `flush()`, or a registered lifecycle adapter — but it cannot be an
internal `pagehide` listener alone.

## Semantic owner and lifetime

The individual leaf owns its key and value. The DRAIN is tree-scoped or
capability-scoped, because the host calls it once for everything.

## Open questions before a disposition

- Is the debounce (~100ms) part of the contract? The drain exists only because
  of it.
- Does anything need persisted *collections*, or only scalar leaves? No
  production evidence for collections.
- Migration (`MigrationFn`) has zero production use. Same question as `tags`.
- Interaction with `stored()` traversal invisibility (a known core defect where
  nested markers leak raw markers into `tree()`) — a re-exported `stored` must
  not re-expose that.

**Disposition: NOT TAKEN.** Needs the offline/local-preferences scenario and a
decision on whether persistence is a leaf marker or a tree capability.

# A3 — async / status representation

## Business jobs

"What does the UI actually need to know? loading? stale? refreshing? failed?
pending mutation?"

## Call sites — 5 files, and the job is MUTATIONS, not loads

```ts
// ticket.state.ts
save:    status<NotifyErrorModel>(),   // create-ticket request
useLast: status<NotifyErrorModel>(),   // recall-most-recent request

// feature-flag.state.ts
load: status<string>(),
```

Driven imperatively from ops services:

```ts
this._$.save.setLoading();
…
tap(() => this._$.save.setLoaded()),
catchError(e => { this._$.save.setError(captureError(e, 'TicketOps.createTicket$')); … })
```

So `status<E>()` is a **declaration-time leaf producing a small typed state
machine** — `setLoading` / `setLoaded` / `setError(E)` in, predicates out — for
async work **SignalTree does not perform itself**.

That is the precise complement of A1. `loader` owns the status of collections
the tree loads; `status` covers everything else: mutations, imperative loads,
and third-party calls. The two together cover the async-state question, and
neither subsumes the other.

**This is the strongest argument in the audit for a genuinely missing
primitive.** `status` was deleted as "the rejected status marker", but the
36 errors it causes are not a consumer clinging to a helper — they are a
consumer with no other way to say "this mutation is in flight and here is its
typed error". Deriving it from `loader` is not possible: there is no loader
involved in `POST /ticket`.

## Semantic owner and lifetime

The leaf. Lifetime is the tree's; the state machine is per-operation-slot, not
per-request.

## Open questions before a disposition

- Is the typed error parameter (`status<NotifyErrorModel>()`) load-bearing, or
  would `unknown` plus a cast do? Every production site parameterizes it.
- Does it need `pending` vs `refreshing` distinction? No evidence here.
- Should mutation status instead come from `transactions()`, given v15 now has
  a real optimistic-mutation story? Worth testing: a ticket save IS an
  optimistic mutation. This is the one place where a v15 capability might
  legitimately absorb a v13 marker.

**Disposition: NOT TAKEN.** The transactions overlap must be tested first.

# A4–A6 — not started

`form` / `FormSignal` / the `@signaltree/ng-forms/signals` subpath, `history`,
and `EntitySignal.map`. Evidence gathering has not run. `A7` (`.with()`) is
already decided — declarative construction, 15.0.

---

## Why this is documented this way

The migration guidance an LLM will need is generated from these dossiers, not
written separately. "`loader(...)` → `<x>`" is only trustworthy if the reason is
recorded next to it, because otherwise the next agent re-litigates the decision
from the historical spelling — which is the weakest evidence there is.
